# Corporate Restructuring Case Study

For this exercise, I followed the "Buying and Selling the Troubled Company" case study posted by Houlihan Lokey. This case study details a hypothetical company, "RuffCo", and walks through the process of restructuring a distressed business. I took notes and replicated the financial models to better understand restructuring.
